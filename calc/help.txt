Calculator Help
1.Command line&Normal use
  When start the calculator with no expression argument,the calculator will
wait for your input.you can type expressions to calculate or arguments to
change the calculator's mode.Type 'q','quit'(or other words begin with q)to
quit the calculator.
  When start the calculator with an expression in the arguments,the calculator
will IGNORE the arguments behind the expression,calculate the
result,and,unless with a '/s' argument,exit.For example:
'./calc /i 123+45 /ob'
The calculator will calculate the expression '123+45' show the result and
quit.Argument '/ob' is ignored but '/i' is not.
'./calc /s 123+45'
The calculator will calculate the expression and wait for your input.
2.Integer mode
  When using '/i' argument,calculator will enter Integer Mode.Under Integer
Mode,you can use '+','-','*' as multiply sign,'/' as division sign,'%' to
calculate the reminder,'<' to left shift,'>' to right shift,and binary signs
like '&','|','^','!'.you can use constant 'last' to represent the last result.but
functions like 'sin','cos' is ,of course,not allowed.
  You can use 2,8,10 and 16 based integer at the same time.However,you should
type a letter at the beginning of the integer to specific the base.'B11001'
means 2-based integer 11001,'o76543' means 8-based ineger 76543,'D99999'or
'99999' means 10-based integer 99999 and 'HA44' means 16-based integer A44.
  You can also make the calculator to use other based integer to sow the
result.Just type these arguments:'/ob' '/oo' '/od' or '/oh'.
3.Normal mode
  When using '/f' argument or no argument,calculator will enter Normal
mode.Under Normal mode you can use '+','-','*','/','^' as power sign,'%' as
percent sign.You can use '[xxx]' as floor sign,'{xxx}' as ceil sign,'<xxx>' as
round sign,'|xxx|' as absolute value sign;constant including
'last','pi','e';functions including sin(),cos(),tan(),asin(),acos(),atan(),
sec(),csc(),sinh(),cosh(),tanh(),sqrt(),ln(),lg().
  You can input numbers in scientific style,like 3.14P2 means 3.14*10^2.You
can also use 2,8,10 or 16 based numbers,just type the same letter as
multibased integers.But there're 2 things to be careful:   1.   The base of one
number should be the same.For example,B1.001101P1110 is a correct number.   2.
The output can only be Demical numbers.
4.File I/O
  You can use a '/r xxxxxxx' argument to let the calculator to read commands from a
file.There could be both expressions and arguments in the input file.Use '/w
xxxx'to output the result into a file.'/w' command will automatically
overwrite the origin file.SO BE CAREFUL!
5.Others
  Wrong Expressions or Math Errors will cause the calculator to Fuck you.But
if a correct expression is fucked,please contact me.
  Both CAPITAL LETTERS and non-capital letters are aceptable,unless in the
filename.
  In integer mode, The Integer will be regard as 64-bit unsigned integers,and '-' is
not allowed as a negative sign.In any mode,'+' is not allowed to be used as a
positive sign.
  One expression should be no longer than 100000 chars.
  Arguments must begin with '/',for '-' might means negative sign.
